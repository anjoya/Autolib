The dataset we are working with is from the autolib network, a public electric car-sharing program/service.
We are investigating a claim that the average number of blue cars taken on friday is greater than the average during the week.
This could be the first step in determining the optimum number of cars made available as we approach the end of the week, servicing patterns for the cars etc..
We are working with a confidence level of 95%.This is a measure of certainty regarding how accurately a sample reflects the population.
Hypothesis statement
H0: μ=113
Ha: μ>113
